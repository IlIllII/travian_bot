Using a webdriver to play the browser game Travian.

This python program uses selenium webdriver to play travian. I made it using a chromedriver and I played romans, I am not sure if it will work for other tribes. I only played for a week and not long enough to get a second village so there are only features for 1 village. I assume it is easy to adapt the code for multiple villages but I would have to see the HTML to make any definitive statements.

Tasks that are currently automated include raiding, building troops, dodging incoming attacks, upgrading resource fields, constructing buildings, and sending hero on adventures.

Thing that need to be added include adapting code for multiple villages, sending raid list through gold club, and setting up trade routes. Also, right now there is no way to start a new construction, only upgrade existing buildings. This is easy to add but I am bored of travian right now.
